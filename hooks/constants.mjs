Your context usage is getting high. Consider creating a handoff to preserve your work:

  /handoff "current-task-topic"

This will:
✅ Save all progress and decisions
✅ Copy summary to clipboard
✅ Enable seamless session resume

Tip: Create handoffs before context gets too high to capture full context.

 */
export const HANDOFF_WARNING_MESSAGE = `⚠️ HANDOFF RECOMMENDED - Context 80%+ Reached

Context space is running low. Strongly recommended to create a handoff now:

  /handoff "current-task-topic"

Benefits:
• Preserve all decisions and failed approaches
• Quality score validates completeness
• Clipboard-ready for next session

Action: Run /handoff soon to avoid losing context.

/**
 * Critical message (90% threshold)
 */
export const HANDOFF_CRITICAL_MESSAGE = `🚨 HANDOFF URGENT - Context 90%+ Reached

Context is almost full. Create a handoff immediately:

  /handoff "current-task-topic"

Without a handoff:
❌ Progress may be lost
❌ Next session starts from scratch
❌ Decisions need re-explaining

Action required: Run /handoff NOW before context overflow.
